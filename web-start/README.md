Rice Hackathon project developed by Computer Science majors Raymond Yuan, Sumeet Agarwal, Alexander Kim, Spencer Chang.
This application uses Firebase as the framework to create a productivity application that aims to connect the world.
Users will find tasks that interest them and compete with others globally to reach their chosen goals.

We aim to continue improving upon this project with Paypal and Facebook integration as well as additional features on 
the user's dashboard.
